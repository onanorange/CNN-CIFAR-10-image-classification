# CNN based CIFAR-10 Image Classifier 

This repository contains two different CNN image classifier trained using two different architectures. The first model is trained on All-CNN architecture which achieves 90% accuracy using Keras framework. The second model is trained on LeNet-5 architecture which achieves 74% accuracy using PyTorch.  

## All - CNN YGNet architecture using Keras 

This model is motivated from the [Striving for Simplicity - All Convolution Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806) paper. The paper achieves 95.6% accuracy using the All-CNN architecture. My model (YGNet) has few changes in the architecture than the All-CNN architecture used in the paper. I've used max-pooling instead of making it a fully convolutional network. The total number of the trainable parameters remains the same i.e. ~1.3M. The changes used in my architecture were made on purpose to understand the effect and importance of certain layers in the convolutional neural network.

### Steps to build 

The source code allows to train the model from scratch. Also, the pre-trained model is present in this repo which generates 90% accuracy. The steps to build the source code is as follows, 
```
$ git clone git@github.com:yogeshgajjar/CNN-CIFAR-10-image-classification.git
$ cd YGNet_Keras
$ python3 CIFAR-10_CNN.py train 
``` 
This will train the model from scratch. The hyper-parameters can be tweaked as per required. 
To load the pre-trained model, 
```
$ cd YGNet_Keras
$ python3 CIFAR-10_CNN.py load
```

## LeNet-5 Architecture using PyTorch 

LeNet-5 is a basic architecture which performance moderately well on CIFAR-10 dataset. LeNet-5 has around ~395k learnable parameters. My model achieved 74% accuracy using PyTorch. This model is trained on Google Colab.
