# CNN based CIFAR-10 Image Classifier using All-CNN architecture(Keras) and LeNet-5 architecture(PyTorch)  

This repository contains two different CNN image classifier trained using two different architectures. The first model is trained on All-CNN architecture which achieves 90% accuracy using Keras framework. The second model is trained on LeNet-5 architecture which achieves 74% accuracy using PyTorch.
